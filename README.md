# Pathfinder
Pathfinder is a 2D Isometric Pathfinding Puzzle Game in Unity. It is currently still in its early stages of development.

# How to Play
You are given a map with a number of tiles including a start tile and an end tile. 
On the start tile, there is a character that searches for the most optimal path to the end tile. 
Once you hit the play button on the top left of the screen, the character begins to move towards the end tile. 
The goal of the game is to prevent the character from reaching the end tile within a certain amount of time. 
You can stall the character by placing blockades causing it to reroute its path.
