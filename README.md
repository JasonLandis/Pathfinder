# Pathfinder

Path a 2D Isometric Pathfinding Puzzle Game in Unity.
You are given a map with a number of tiles including a start tile and an end tile. On the start tile, there is a character that searches for the most optimal path to the end tile. Once you hit the play button on the top left of the screen, the character begins to move towards the end tile. The goal of the game is to prevent the character from reaching the end tile within a certain amount of time. You can stall the character by placing blockades causing it to reroute its path.
The goal is to get the green character from the green tile on the bottom to the green tile on the top.  
The green pathway shows the pathway.
